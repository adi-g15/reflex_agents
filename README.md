# Reflex Agents

> Big revamp in process, this will be moved into [WorldLine simulator](https://github.com/adi-g15/worldLineSim/)

Some reflex agents... an assignment at [NIT Patna](nitp.ac.in/)

It is a beginner's (me) assingment, don't hope any research stuff :D

**Read the document files in this, they have a brief 2 page report on both.**

It was some **good assignment** to get hands dirty on, I coded quite long a simulator after my [Worldline simulator](https://github.com/adi-g15/worldLineSim/)
